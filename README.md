# VOICE OPERATED MENU (task 9.1)

In this task we have created a python menu program which is operated using voice. The user speaks what he/she wants to achieve from the given options and the program will switch  
on the mic.
What the user says is recorded and stored. This statement is given to the program and based on the words used , desired function is performed. 

This program can be used to operate multiple technologies using voice. 
And the program understands human like statements which makes this program even more easy to use.
